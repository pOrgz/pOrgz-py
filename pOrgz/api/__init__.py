    A new/existing user will reside in ``.users`` directory for and :class:`pOrgz.pOrgz` to work,

    Once the directory is created, all individual user have their own database, where
    the name of the user is the name of the database which contains all the files.

    Currently, all the information is stored in an unencrypted DB (provided by ``SQLite3``),
    but later, this should be moved to a secure database, or an encryption policy will be set.
    
    :param username: as :mod:`pOrgz` supports multi-user, this looks for the username in
                     the directory ``.users``, if not found then it invokes necessary commands
                     to create the database and all the associated tables.
                     This function should later be used by RestAPI, when integrated with GUI.
